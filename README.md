#### **Production Cost and Quantity Produced Trend**  
---
- **Production Cost (2025)**: Dropped from $3.85M → $2.59M, but unit cost stayed flat (~$18.9/unit), suggesting no major efficiency gains.
- **Quantity Produced**: Fell sharply from 202K → 137K, indicating a possible operational disruption.

**Recommendations**:
- Investigate equipment, supply chain, or workforce issues.
- Implement overtime, shift planning, or temporary outsourcing.
- Focus on cutting waste, renegotiating suppliers, and auditing energy consumption.
- Set alerts for production drops and cost spikes to ensure early detection of issues.

#### **Total Warehouse Contribution**  
---
- **Top Performers**: West (26.1%), East (25.71%)
- **Underperformer**: South (23.06%)

**Recommendations**:
- Investigate low output in the South warehouse and replicate processes from the West and East.
- Upskill the South warehouse team based on the standards set by the top-performing locations.
- Assess whether any tools or technologies are lacking in the South warehouses.

#### **Production Across Country of Origin**  
---
- **Top Performers**: USA & Germany, likely due to advanced automation and strong operational processes.
- **Underperformers**: India & China are underperforming, though not drastically.
- **Lagging**: Japan has the lowest performance, possibly due to structural or capacity issues.

**Recommendations**:
- Benchmark operations in the USA and Germany to identify successful processes, technologies, and automation.
- Invest in workforce development and automation in underperforming regions (Japan, China, India) to improve performance.
- Close gaps in automation and robotics, especially in countries showing lower output.

#### **Product Cost Across Product Type**  
---
- **Automobile and Textiles** are the biggest cost drivers.
- **Machinery** has the lowest production cost, indicating operational efficiency or lower volume.

**Recommendations**:
- Furhter Investigating , Are raw materials, labor, or logistics driving costs.
- Re-evaluate vendors and materials for cost-heavy products.
- Assess automation opportunities in Textiles & Furniture to lower recurring costs.

#### **Cost Per Unit Across Products**  
---
- **Automobiles** have the highest unit cost, possibly due to complex components, higher labor, or longer cycle times.
- **Machinery, Furniture, and Electronics** maintain a lean cost per unit of ~$18.8.

**Recommendations**:
- Increase automation in Textiles & Automobiles to bring unit costs down.
- Implement best practices from Machinery across other product types.
- Monitor production closely to spot inefficiencies.

#### **Employee Across Departments**  
---
- **Sales** (21.2%) and **Human Resources** (20.18%) have the highest headcount.
- **Production** has the lowest headcount (19.28%).

**Recommendations**:
- Ensure resource allocation matches workload and strategic goals, especially in Sales and Logistics.
- Reassess staffing needs in Production and Quality Control if performance is impacted.

#### **Average Salary by Year**  
---
- Average salary has been decreasing over time:
  - 2020: $55,706
  - 2021: $54,772
  - 2022: $54,042

**Recommendations**:
- Monitor employee morale and retention—declining pay may affect motivation.
- Conduct pay audits to ensure competitiveness and fairness.

#### **Average Performance Ratings by Department**  
---
- **Logistics** leads with an average rating of 5.4.
- **Sales** has the lowest average rating at 4.5.

**Recommendations**:
- Recognize and replicate best practices from Logistics.
- Investigate root causes of low ratings in Sales (training, leadership, workload, etc.).

#### **Tenure-wise Average Performance**  
---
- Performance improves with tenure:
  - 3–4 years: 4.7
  - 4–5 years: 4.9
  - 5+ years: 5.2

**Recommendations**:
- Prioritize retention strategies—experienced employees perform better.
- Create mentorship programs to transfer knowledge from senior employees.

#### **Performance Rating Across Country of Operation and Department**  
---
- **Germany (Production)** has the highest performance rating (5.73).
- **USA (Sales)** has the lowest (4.12).

**Recommendations**:
- Study Germany’s production practices and consider applying them globally.
- Address performance issues in USA Sales through training or leadership review.

#### **Department-wise Low Performance High Salary Employees**  
---
- High-salary employees with low ratings (as low as 1.0) found across departments, especially in **Sales, Logistics, and Production**.

**Recommendations**:
- Conduct performance reviews and create action plans for underperforming high-cost employees.
- Explore role reassignment or development plans before considering exits.
